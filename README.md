# üê∂üê± Dog vs Cat Image Classification

This repository contains my solution for the [Dog vs Cat Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-vs-cat-classification/data) Kaggle competition. The goal is to build a classifier that can distinguish between images of dogs and cats.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset is available on Kaggle and contains:

- `train/` ‚Äî 25,000 labeled images (cats and dogs)
- `test/` ‚Äî 8,000 unlabeled images
- `sample_submission.csv` ‚Äî required format for Kaggle submission

## üß† Models Used

### ‚úÖ InceptionV3 (Keras / TensorFlow)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Approach**: Transfer Learning
- **Modifications**:
  - `include_top=False`
  - `GlobalAveragePooling2D`
  - Final `Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')` for binary classification
- **Loss**: Binary Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam

### ‚úÖ MobileNetV3 Small (PyTorch)
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Approach**: Transfer Learning with fine-tuning
- **Modifications**:
  - Replaced classifier head for binary output
  - Used `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()` for training
- **Optimizer**: Adam

Both models were trained, validated, and compared for accuracy and performance.
